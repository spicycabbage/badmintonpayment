# Screenshot Tips for Best OCR Results

## What Works Best

The OCR works great with screenshots that contain:
- **Simple text lists** (one name per line)
- **Clear, readable fonts**
- **Good contrast** (dark text on light background)
- **Standard orientation** (not rotated)

## Example Formats That Work Well

### ✅ Good Examples:

**Registration list format:**
```
John Smith
Sarah Johnson
Mike Williams
Emily Chen
David Brown
```

**Numbered list:**
```
1. Alex Thompson
2. Lisa Anderson
3. Mark Davis
```

**Spreadsheet screenshot:**
```
Name
------
Chris Lee
Jessica Park
Ryan Martinez
```

**WhatsApp/Text message list:**
```
Players for tonight:
- Kevin Wang
- Michelle Liu
- Tom Garcia
```

## Tips

1. **Crop the image** to show only the names section if possible
2. **Avoid** screenshots with lots of other text (headers, footers, timestamps)
3. The OCR will extract all text - you can remove unwanted items in the review screen
4. **Works offline** - just needs internet for the initial OCR processing

## What Happens After Upload

1. App sends image to OCR service
2. Extracts all text from image
3. Filters out obvious non-name text (URLs, emails, very long lines)
4. Shows you a review screen
5. You tap any incorrect entries to remove them
6. Tap "Add X Participants" to import
