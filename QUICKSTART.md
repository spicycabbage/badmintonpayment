# Quick Start - Mobile Web

## Run Locally (On Your Computer)

1. **Install and start:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run web
   ```

2. **Find your local network URL:**
   - Look for output like: `Metro waiting on exp://192.168.x.x:8081`
   - The web version is at: `http://192.168.x.x:8081`

3. **Open on your phone:**
   - Make sure your phone is on the same WiFi network
   - Open your phone's browser (Safari/Chrome)
   - Type in the URL from step 2

4. **Add to home screen (optional but recommended):**
   - **iPhone**: Tap Share button → "Add to Home Screen"
   - **Android**: Tap menu (⋮) → "Add to Home Screen"
   - This gives you an app icon and full-screen experience
